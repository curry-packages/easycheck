easycheck: libraries for automated, property-based testing
==========================================================

EasyCheck is a library for automated, property-based testing of
Curry programs. The ideas behind EasyCheck are described in the
[FLOPS 2008 paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78969-7_23).

These libraries are used by the CurryCheck tool which automatically
executes tests defined with these libraries.
CurryCheck supports the definition of unit tests
(also for I/O operations) and property tests parameterized
over some arguments. CurryCheck is described in more detail in the
[LOPSTR 2016 paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63139-4_13).
