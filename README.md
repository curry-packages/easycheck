easycheck: libraries for automated, property-based testing
==========================================================

EasyCheck is a library for automated, property-based testing of
Curry programs. The ideas behind EasyCheck are described in
[this paper](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sebf/pub/flops08.html).

These libraries are used by the CurryCheck tool which automatically
executes tests defined with these libraries.
CurryCheck supports the definition of unit tests
(also for I/O operations) and property tests parameterized
over some arguments. CurryCheck is described in more detail in
[this paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/LOPSTR16.html).
