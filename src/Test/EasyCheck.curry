--- EasyCheck is a library for automated, property-based testing of
--- Curry programs. The ideas behind EasyCheck are described in
--- [this paper](http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sebf/pub/flops08.html).
--- The CurryCheck tool automatically executes tests defined with
--- this library. CurryCheck supports the definition of unit tests
--- (also for I/O operations) and property tests parameterized
--- over some arguments. CurryCheck is described in more detail in
--- [this paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/LOPSTR16.html).
---
--- Note that this module defines the interface of EasyCheck to
--- define properties. The operations to actually execute the tests
--- are contained in the accompanying library `Test.EasyCheckExec`.
